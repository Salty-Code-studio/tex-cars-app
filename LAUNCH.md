# Tex Cars — Go-Live Runbook

Everything needed to take the Phase 2 platform from this repo to a live site at
`app.tex-cars.com`. Steps marked **[owner]** need accounts/keys only the owner has.

## 1. Provision managed services [owner]

| Service | What | Gives you |
|---|---|---|
| **Supabase** (or Neon) | Postgres database | `DATABASE_URL` = transaction pooler (`:6543`, add `?sslmode=require`) for runtime; `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL` = direct connection (`:5432`) for migrations |
| **Upstash** | Redis (rate-limit store) | `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` |
| **Stripe** | Payments (test then live) | a **restricted** key `rk_...`, and a webhook signing secret `whsec_...` |
| **Resend** | Transactional email | `RESEND_API_KEY` `re_...`, and a verified sender domain for `EMAIL_FROM` |
| **Vercel** | Hosting | the deployment + cron |

## 2. Generate secrets

```bash
openssl rand -base64 48   # SESSION_SECRET
openssl rand -base64 32   # DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY  (NEVER rotate without re-encrypting licence rows)
openssl rand -hex 32      # CRON_SECRET
```

## 3. Set environment variables in Vercel [owner]

From `.env.example` — every variable is validated at boot (the app refuses to
start if any required one is missing or weak):

- `NODE_ENV=production`, `APP_ORIGIN=https://app.tex-cars.com`, `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://app.tex-cars.com`
- `SESSION_SECRET`, `SESSION_TTL_SECONDS=86400`, `SESSION_IDLE_TTL_SECONDS=1800`
- `DATABASE_URL` (Supabase transaction pooler `:6543`, `?sslmode=require`), `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL` (Supabase direct `:5432`; optional), `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- `PAYMENT_MODE` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_MODE` — must match; `stripe` (online checkout, default) or `reserve` (pay-at-desk, no Stripe). `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_MODE` is baked into the client bundle at build time, so it must also be set as a Docker build-time `ENV` (see Dockerfile) matching the runtime value.
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (restricted), `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — only required when `PAYMENT_MODE=stripe`
- `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM="Tex Cars <bookings@tex-cars.com>"`
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`
- `CRON_SECRET`
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` — optional; set both to also push owner alerts to Telegram
- `TRUST_PROXY=true`  (Vercel overwrites `x-forwarded-for`, so per-client rate limiting works)

## 4. Database

Run these once with the env above loaded. `db:migrate` uses `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL`
(the Supabase direct `:5432` connection) when set, otherwise `DATABASE_URL`. The
booking exclusion constraint's `btree_gist` extension is created by migration 0002,
so there is nothing to enable in the Supabase dashboard.

```bash
npm run db:migrate    # applies drizzle/ migrations (direct connection)
npm run db:seed       # settings, insurance tiers, add-ons, and the placeholder fleet
npm run admin:create -- owner@tex-cars.com   # prints a one-time password; MFA is forced at first login
```

Then sign in at `https://app.tex-cars.com/admin`, enrol your authenticator app,
and replace the placeholder fleet/prices under **Fleet & pricing**, set the real
**reservation fee / deposits / guardrails** under **Settings**, and publish the
**Rental terms / Cancellation / Privacy** policies under **Policies**.

## 5. Stripe webhook [owner]

In the Stripe dashboard add a webhook endpoint:
- URL: `https://app.tex-cars.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
- Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded`, `checkout.session.async_payment_failed`
- Copy its signing secret into `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

Local testing: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe`.

## 6. DNS [owner]

Point `app.tex-cars.com` at Vercel (CNAME) and add the domain in the Vercel project.

## 7. Flip the Phase 1 site to live

In `~/Desktop/saltycodestudio-clients/tex-cars-rental/site/data/config.js` set
`bookingEnabled: true`. Every CTA on the marketing site then deep-links into this
app, and the footer policy links resolve to the published policies. Re-deploy the
static site.

## 8. Pre-launch smoke tests

- [ ] `curl https://app.tex-cars.com/api/health` → `{"status":"ok","db":true}`
- [ ] Admin: login → MFA → edit a vehicle, change the reservation fee, publish a policy → see them in the audit log.
- [ ] Customer: open `/book`, get a quote, fill the licence, **pay with a Stripe test card** (4242 4242 4242 4242), land on the confirmation, and watch it flip to **confirmed** when the webhook lands.
- [ ] Confirm the booking appears (blue) on the admin **Planning board**.
- [ ] Customer: sign in at `/account/login` (real email via Resend now), see the booking, cancel it, confirm the slot frees up.
- [ ] Check `email_log` shows `sent` rows (login code, booking confirmed, admin alerts).
- [ ] The cron fires: Vercel → Cron → `/api/cron/expire-holds` runs every 15 min.

## 9. Security checklists (fort) before go-live

Run each relevant checklist in `~/Desktop/saltycodestudio-fort/checklists/`:
`auth-checklist`, `ecommerce-security`, `api-security-checklist`,
`deployment-hardening`, `secrets-and-env`, `owasp-top-10`.

## What this build already enforces

- Argon2id admin auth + mandatory TOTP MFA + account lockout + hardened sessions
- Postgres exclusion constraint = no double-booking AND turnaround buffer, even under a race
- Server-computed prices snapshotted on every booking; Stripe handles all card data
- Idempotent, signature-verified webhooks; one charge per booking; unpaid holds expire
- AES-256-GCM (AAD-bound) encryption of licence number + DOB, with a retention timer
- Passwordless customers, owner-scoped data, CSRF on every mutation, audit log on every admin action
- Strict CSP (API) + app CSP with clickjacking protection (pages), HSTS, secure headers
- Rate limiting (Upstash Redis across instances when configured)

## Known follow-ups (owner decisions / later)

- Refund handling on cancellation (spec §16): decide whether the reservation fee is refundable or credited.
- Pre-pickup reminder + low-stock email (scheduled jobs — add to vercel.json crons).
- CSP hardening: move script-src to a per-request nonce + `strict-dynamic` (currently `'unsafe-inline'`).
- Real fleet photos to private storage; automated ID verification (e.g. Stripe Identity) if desired.
