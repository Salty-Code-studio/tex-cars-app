/**
 * Breakdown swap: move a booking onto a replacement car when its assigned car is
 * out of action, WITHOUT touching the dates or the price. This is the deliberate
 * counterpart to {@link moveBooking}:
 *
 *  - it works for a `picked_up` booking too (the car is out with the customer and
 *    has broken down): the status is preserved, only the vehicle changes;
 *  - it never re-quotes. A breakdown is not the customer's fault, so the original
 *    price snapshot, add-on lines and totals are left exactly as they were, even
 *    if the replacement car normally costs more or less.
 *
 * The replacement car is still guarded by the same physical exclusion constraint
 * as everything else, so a swap can never double-book a car. A soft block/blackout
 * on the target surfaces as an `advisory_conflict` the desk can explicitly
 * override; a real booking clash can never be overridden.
