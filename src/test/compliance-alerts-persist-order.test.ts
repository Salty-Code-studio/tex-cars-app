/**
 * Regression: runComplianceAlerts must PERSIST the new alert stage marker
 * before dispatching notifyAdmin/alertOwner, not after.
 *
 * The old order (notify, then persist) leaves a window where the alert has
 * already gone out but the DB stage still shows the stale value. A crash in
 * that window (process kill, serverless timeout, transient DB error on the
 * write) means the marker never advances, so the very next cron run sees
 * `target > recorded` again and fires (and sends) the SAME stage a second
 * time; the operator gets duplicate "insurance overdue" pings for one
 * event. Persist-then-notify closes that window: once the write commits, a
 * crash can only ever skip the notification, never duplicate it.
 *
 * This is proven here by inspecting the DB row from WITHIN a mocked
 * notifyAdmin/alertOwner call: by the time either dispatch fires, the stage
 * column must already equal the new target stage, not the value it replaced.
