/**
 * Regression coverage for the planning-board drag-to-move bug: dragging a
 * booking bar moved the underlying booking, but the browser's own synthetic
 * `click` (fired right after `pointerup` ends any drag) then re-opened the
 * BookingDrawer on top of it, because the bar's onClick checked the gesture
 * ref, which `handleUp` had already nulled out *before* that click ever
 * fires. From the click handler's point of view, "just finished a real drag"
 * and "a plain click" were indistinguishable (both saw a null ref), so every
 * successful drag-move looked like it "did nothing": the drawer just
 * popped open instead.
 *
 * DragClickGuard is the actual fix: `handleUp` arms it exactly when the
 * gesture that just ended moved something; the bar's onClick consumes it and
 * swallows that one echo click. A genuine plain click (no preceding drag)
 * must still open the drawer as before.
