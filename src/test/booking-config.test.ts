/**
 * The booking wizard (book/page.tsx) used to hardcode business hours as
 * 08:00-18:00 and had no live updater wired to a real source, so an operator
 * with custom hours would have out-of-hours slots offered by the TimeSelect
 * controls; the quote then fails closed with a "must be between X and Y"
 * 4xx. /api/booking-config is the wizard's one non-quote, pre-selection read
 * of settings, so it must carry the real openingTime/closingTime (not just
 * the driver-age config) for the wizard to initialize its hours correctly
 * BEFORE the customer picks a time.
